# Panda Recommender

## Description

This is a simple recommender system for the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library. It might use the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library to train a model on a dataset of pandas functions and their descriptions. The model is then used to recommend functions based on a user's input.
